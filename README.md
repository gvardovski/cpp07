is a C++ educational repository focused on Module 07 from the classic 42 school curriculum, diving deep into C++ templates and generic programming. 📚✨ Built with C++98 standards (-std=c++98), the repo is structured as a series of progressive exercises—each tackling different aspects of template usage.

📂 Structure:
ex00 – "Whatever" 🎲
Introduction to template functions: implements generic swap, min, and max that work with any type (ints, strings, etc.). Clean, type-safe utilities showing how templates eliminate code duplication. ⚙️

ex01 – Iterator/Template Function Application 🔁
Likely explores template functions that operate on arrays or collections (e.g., applying a function to each element)—building fluency with iteration patterns in a generic context. 🧩

ex02 – Template Classes / Advanced Patterns 🏗️
Typically involves building a templated class (like a simple container or wrapper), reinforcing how to write reusable, type-independent data structures. 🛠️

🎯 Purpose:
Master the fundamentals of compile-time polymorphism, strengthen understanding of type deduction, and develop clean, reusable C++ code—all while wrestling with the joys (and pains 😅) of template compilation errors!

Perfect for anyone leveling up their C++ template skills or revisiting the classics. 🧠💻🔥
